# Overview

This game is a simple platforming game where you play as a rabbit who collects coins by jumping on different platforms. You lose as soon as your character is hit by an obstacle. To control the character, you move them left and right using the "J" and "L" keys and jump using the "I" key. The reason for this is that my laptop has small arrow keys that are difficult to use.

The reason I made this game using this software was to see if I could quickly put together a game in a game engine that I am somewhat familiar with.

# Development Environment

The game was developed using the Game Maker Studio 2 development environment on my MacBook.

The programming language used in this project is called GML or Game Maker Language.
